Available at Codeplex (for now):

http://spcamlqueryhelper.codeplex.com/

Project Description

Use this program to help build and test SharePoint CAML Queries (Collaborative Application Markup Language). Compatible with WSS 3.0, MOSS 2007, Foundation 2010, and SharePoint 2010. Very similar to U2U CAML Query Builder for SharePoint 2003 and SharePoint 2007. This app uses the SharePoint Object Model to connect to a site using a URL (instead of web services). Gets all webs in a site, all lists in a web, and all fields/columns in a list. Can export field information to CSV. Also provides interface for building XML CAML Queries, with tools to make it easier managing field names (using drag-drop and copy-to-clipboard commands). Specify a query, the viewfields, and a row limit (0 to ignore) and run your query. Results are output to a sortable grid and the data can be exported to CSV. The grid shows the fields that are selected in the viewfields. Newtonsoft JSON.NET API is used to dump the content of listitems. App.config file can used to specify default Site URL to connect when opening file.
